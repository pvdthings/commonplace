# commonplace

Welcome to the Commonplace monorepo, where all modules of the Commonplace platform will live.

The Commonplace platform is based on the PVD Things software suite, but will evolve into a modular community operating system for the web.

The "social network" of the past two decades is dying. People are tired of befriending accounts and speaking with avatars. It's time for a software platform that facilitates REAL social networks to form within and between our communities.

More to come.
